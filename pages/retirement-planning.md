title: Retirement Planning
---

This project was created to provide some guidelines and forecasts for the following questions:

- How much do I need to retire?
- How much will inflation or interest rates affect my retirement portfolio, both before and during retirement?
- How much do I need in my superannuation / investment portfolio today in order for a comfortable retirement in the future?

## Retirement Income / Expenses

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Limited (ASFA) is the largest policy, research and advocacy body for the Australian superannuation (pension) industry; a non-profit advisor to the Australian government.

ASFA have published a "[retirement standard](retirement-expenses.md)" of living expenses that lists how much money the average Australian individual or couple spends each year in retirement. Their latest figures are based on [previous 2018 research data](https://www.superannuation.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2018-ASFA-Retirement-Standard-Budgets-Review.pdf) (subsequently adjusted for inflation each quarter).

## Superannuation Investments

Superannuation funds must be sufficient enough and provide sufficient returns to cover retirement expenses over an extended period of retirement. The higher the fund performance (above inflation) the more money available to fund retirement expenses.

The [S&P 500 Index data](spx.md) show a consistent stock market performance of 11% - 12% over many decades (excluding dividends and stock buybacks). 

**Many superannuation 'growth' funds significantly underperform this baseline.** 

> You might want to consider alternative funds (or even a self-managed super fund) if your current superannuation fund manager cannot outperform a simple 'dollar cost average' into the S&P 500 baseline.

## Retirement Lifestyles

The ASFA retirement standard models expenses for a "comfortable" and a "modest" lifestyle. 

A "comfortable" retirement should be used as minimum baseline. Its reasonably "good" but is not luxurious.

The "modest" retirement is a borderline survival level, with basic and limited expenses, cheap old car, and importantly _"a need to keep close watch on utility costs and make sacrifices"_.

I have extended the model with additional levels factored at 200%, 300% and 500% of the "modest" lifestyle.

| Couple  | Modest  | Comfortable | Four Star | Luxury   | Opulent  |
|---------|--------:|------------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| Annual  | $50,000 |     $75,000 |  $100,000 | $150,000 | $250,000 |
| Monthly | $4,166  |      $6,250 |    $8,333 |  $12,500 |  $20,833 |
| Diff    | 100%    |        150% |      200% |     300% |     500% |

"Luxury" lifestyle could include for example, economy upgrade to business class, the "opulent" lifestyle is first class.

The models _assume you own your own home_ because home ownership affects the government Age Pension entitlements. Take any additional mortgage or rental expenses into account.
