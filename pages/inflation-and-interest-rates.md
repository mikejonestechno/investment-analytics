## Inflation and Interest Rates

The Reserve Bank of Australia has often increased base interest rates aledging a high correlation between interest rates and inflation.

This appears a reasonable construct from basic supply and demand economics; when households have high disposable income, demand for non-essential goods and services increases, and prices increase to meet demand, resulting in inflation. Increasing interest rates reduces the disposable income for those with high debt, reduces demand, resulting in reduced inflation.

Is there really a high correlation, or is this over simplification? Perhaps there are other external factors influencing inflation, such as global oil prices, foreign war, pandemic supply chains, that have nothing to do with household disposable income?
