## [Tesla (TSLA)](tsla.md)

The [mission of Tesla](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730145205/https://www.tesla.com/blog/mission-tesla) has been clear from day one: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. In advancing it's mission Tesla has reluctantly expanded to building components (and refining materials) themselves where global supply chains could not guarantee the success of this mission.

Telsa's cheeky CEO publicly shared his [secret master plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) in August 2006 four years before the NASDAQ IPO on 29 June 2010. 

The Tesla share price has extensive periods of high volatility and equally compressed periods of extreme gains. What started as an electric vehicle manufacturer had already expanded to adjacent industries in solar and battery pack manufacturing, and factory robotics. 

The less secret [master plan part deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) was published July 2016 with [master plan part 3](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-3) in April 2023.  The outdated Tesla mission statement was removed from the company website around July 2024 and arguably Tesla has met that mission (and is no longer "just a car company").

### ARK Invest Price Targets

On 7 August 2018 Musks' infamous "funding secured" tweet considered a potential buy back at $420 per share. Given TSLA was trading around $240 a share, that may have seemed a reasonably strong 2x return on investment.

Two weeks later on 22 August 2018, Ark Invest CEO Cathy Woods published a blog titled "Dear Elon: An Open Letter Against Taking Tesla Private" in which Cathy explained the enormous disruptive growth potential over a long term (five year) time horizon.

Tesla remained a public company and ARK Invest continued to publish research on disruptive innovation - including four year price targets for Tesla.
