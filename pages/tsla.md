# Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla's IPO on the NASDAQ was on 29 June 2010. The shares were priced at $17 finishing the day at $23.89; split adjusted to current (2023) price is $1.59.

The Model S was launched in June 2012 and Tesla had a significant spike in 2013 (up 600% year over year) as the company reported their first ever profitable quarter after ten years in the car industry.

Subsequent quarters returned to net losses of hundreds of millions of dollars until Tesla demonstrated final mass production of the Model 3 in 2019 and survived the last make-or-break risk of bankruptcy if they failed. The share price spiked in 2020 (up 1000%) helped in part by the economic environment of low interest rates, low inflation and boom in tech stock growth through the pandemic.

The Year over Year annual price change helps visualize potential investment returns, although Tesla only has around 10 years of data for the 3 year rolling average, Tesla was reasonably consistent around 150% YoY 2014 to 2016, then around +10% to +15% YoY between 2017 to 2020, then ramped and stayed over 200% YoY between 2021 to 2023. 

With significant variation, some periods Tesla price "only" increases around 10% YoY and at other times over 200%, the average YoY increase is 110% - the share price doubles every year.

> The data suggests a reasonable conservative baseline of 15% to 20% over a multi-decade time horizon, with some uncertainty or risk that the price may go down or significantly higher for short periods of time. Note this does not take inflation into consideration.
