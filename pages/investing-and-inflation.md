## [S&P 500 Index](spx-prices.html)

The S&P 500 Index from Standard & Poor's is a market-capitalization-weighted index tracking the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US. 

The S&P 500 is widely considered one of the best gauges of overall stock market performance because of its depth and diversity, tracking the top performing companies by market capitalization.

See [SPX 500 Index](spx-prices.html) for inflation charts, trends and analysis.

## [Inflation](inflation.html)

The Consumer Price Index that the Reserve Bank of Australia use to index inflation is published quarterly, one month after the end of each quarter.

See [inflation](inflation.html) for inflation charts, trends and analysis.

While inflation may have a direct impact on company profitability and subsequently market prices, there is not a strong correlation between inflation and investment returns.

The S&P 500 Index is reasonably volatility over a multi year time horizon regardless of inflation.

## General Investing Guidelines

Plotting interest rate and investment YoY change may help provide general investing guidelines. 

When interest rates are higher than investement returns, it may mmake sense to invest in short term treasury bonds rather than make stock investments, particularly when interest rates are high and investment returns are low and uncertain; such as the period between 1975 and 1985. 

In these conditions it makes sense for home owners to borrow on princpal and interest terms to pay down mortgage capital and interest on other loans as quickly as possible because the return on investments may not be sufficient to cover the interest repayments.

When investment returns are higher than interest rates, it makes sense to invest in stocks rather than treasury bonds, particularly when the investment returns are significantly high.

In these conditions it may make sense for home owners to borrow on interest only terms (when available) and defer or minimize pay down of mortgage capital because maximizing the return on investment should more than cover interest and capital repayments.

The size of capital borrowed and invested have significant impact and personal financial situation should be considered with any financial decision.
