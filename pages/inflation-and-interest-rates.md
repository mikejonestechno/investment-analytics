## Inflation and Interest Rates

The Reserve Bank of Australia has often increased base interest rates alledging a high correlation between interest rates and inflation.

This appears a reasonable construct from basic supply and demand economics; when households have high disposable income, demand for non-essential goods and services increases, and if supply is limited, prices increase to meet demand, resulting in inflation. 

Increasing interest rates reduces disposable income (for those with borrowing debt), thus reducing some demand for non-essential goods and services, potentially resulting in some price reductions, and subsequently reducing inflation.

Is there really a high correlation, or is this over simplification? Do lower interest rates subsequently cause inflation to rise, and higher interest rates subsequently cause inflation to reduce?

Perhaps there are other external factors influencing inflation, such as global oil prices, foreign war, pandemic supply chains, that have nothing to do with household disposable income?
