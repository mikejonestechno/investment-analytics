The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Limited ASFA is the largest policy, research and advocacy body for the superanuation (pension) industry; a non-profit advisor to the Australian government.

ASFA have published a "standard" listing of how much money is required each year for a "comfortable" retirement. Their latest figures are based on [previous 2018 research data](https://www.superannuation.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2018-ASFA-Retirement-Standard-Budgets-Review.pdf) (subsequently adjusted for inflation each quarter).

The model estimates how much the average Australian individual or couple would spend each year (in today's dollars) on each listed expense category to live a "comfortable" lifestyle in retirement.

They define a "comfortable" lifestyle enables a retiree to be involved in a broad range of leisure and recreational activities and to have a good standard of living through the purchase of things such as household goods, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, a range of electronic equipment, and domestic and occasionally international holiday travel. It assumes you own your own home and are reasonably healthy.

## Retirement Lifestyles

The "comfortable" retirement should be used as minimum baseline. Its reasonably "good" but is not luxurious.

The "modest" retirement is a borderline survival level, with basic and limited expenses, cheap old car, and a "need to keep close watch on utility costs and make sacrifices".

I extended the model with additional levels factored at 200%, 300% and 500% of the "modest" lifestyle.

| Couple  | Modest  | Comfortable | Four Star | Luxury   | Opulent  |
|---------|--------:|------------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| Annual  | $45,808 |     $70,482 |   $91,616 | $137,424 | $229,040 |
| Monthly | $3,817  |      $5,874 |    $7,635 |  $11,452 |  $19,087 |
| Diff    | 100%    |        150% |      200% |     300% |     500% |

"Luxury" lifestyle could include for example, economy upgrade to business class, the "opulent" lifestyle is first class.

The models assume you own your own home so take any additional mortgage expenses into account.

## Misleading Data

> ⚠ WARNING: CHOICE say the ASFA Retirement Standard is misleading.

>"The expert view is that these standards may be misleading (too high). The Productivity Commission said these standards equate to a retirement income that is 'more than many people spend _before_ retirement', and that they are "no more than an arbitrary benchmark that should be ignored in policymaking".

### Fake News and Misinformation 

The above statements from the Productivity Commission appear to be based on claims made by the Grattan Institute about the earlier ASFA 2009 research. The ASFA refuted these claims in their 2018 research stating that data from the ABS Household Expenditure Survey indicates the mean and median disposable incomes of existing retirees *are higher than the ASFA comfortable retirement standard*.

> I believe the ASFA could be a useful benchmark, subject to validation with *actual* personal expenses. Personalized data will tend to be more accurate than a generalized model.

While true that many people may be on a "modest" lifestyle _before_ retirement, my *actual* expenses show the "comfortable" lifestyle is reasonably close to our current standard of living (less mortgage); the ASFA model appears reasonably acurate for a baseline model. 

## Improving Accuracy and Assumptions

The ASFA standard is based on their 2018 research that they regularly adjust for inflation. 

They claim that adjusting for inflation "over the short term — a period which various researchers have indicated is in the order of around seven years — will not result in any major errors into the estimates in terms of overall required expenditure and the size of various components of the budgets". They also acknowledge over the longer term general living standards and expectations will increase "in line with economic growth and community prosperity" and that the CPI inflation data bundles goods and services that differ to the component budgets used in the retirement standard.

After seven years technology innovations and price changes can have dramatic affect on household budget. "When almost everyone else has a mobile phone or a broadband internet connection, it becomes near impossible for anyone to manage without one. An item that was once seen as a relative 'luxury' quickly becomes an absolute ‘necessity’. Technology also changes, with, for instance, subscriptions to streaming services substantially replacing purchase of compact discs or DVDs."

ASFA also aknowledge the need to periodically review government policy changes such as tax and health care benefits. 

This also means that projecting retirement expenses and balanced beyond seven years could become increasingly flawed, particularly beyond fifteen years!

> The ASFA retirement standard is **due for a significant review and entire revision** in 2025-26 (seven years from the 2018 baseline).


## Inflation Adjustments

It appears that a generic average inflation is applied, so the model could be more accurate if each category was adjusted separately, given cost of some goods can increase significantly while other expenses remain stable.

>"All figures in today’s dollars using 2.75% AWE as a deflator and an assumed investment earning rate of 6 per cent. The fact that the same savings are required for both couples and singles reflects the impact of receiving the Age Pension."

The ASFA standard has a split for individuals and couples, and for those aged over 85 which they assume will have much less international flights and entertainment expenses, but higher medical expenses. It's unclear to me how these absolute values are determined and what the real expense curves may look like.

It's also unfortunate that the model attempts to calculate precise absolute values instead of a range of values with probability of those values.

## Forecast Accuracy

Imagine that the ASFA forecasts of absolute values are out by +/- 20% to form a standard distribution range of values. Some expense categories could be forecast to greater degree of accuracy than others.

A monte carlo simulation could provide more reliable ranges of expense probability forecasts rather than the absolute values provided by the standard model.

When costs do increase, some categories such as food are more essential than entertainment and holidays so its not clear to me how accurate the category weighting is for the lifestyles and if it could be modelled more accurately.

> There is opportunity to develop a more accurate modelling of expenses, although based on my own *actual* expenses, the ASFA appears reasonably accurate for an initial baseline model.
