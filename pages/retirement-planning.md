title: Retirement Planning
---

This project was created to provide some guidelines and forecasts for the following questions:

- How much do I need to retire?
- How much will inflation or interest rates affect my retirement portfolio, both before and during retirement?
- How much do I need in my superannuation / investment portfolio today in order for a comfortable retirement in the future?

## Retirement Expenses

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Limited (ASFA) is the largest policy, research and advocacy body for the Australian superannuation (pension) industry; a non-profit advisor to the Australian government.

ASFA have published a "retirement standard" of living expenses that lists how much money the average Australian individual or couple spends each year in retirement. Their latest figures are based on [previous 2018 research data](https://www.superannuation.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2018-ASFA-Retirement-Standard-Budgets-Review.pdf) (subsequently adjusted for inflation each quarter).

## Superannuation Investment Portfolio

Superannuation funds must be sufficient enough and provide sufficient returns to cover retirement expenses over an extended period of retirement.

Given the multi-decade history, the [S&P 500 Index data](spx.md) suggests high confidence using a baseline stock market performance of 12% with some uncertainty or risk that stocks can go up or down for several years at a time. **Many superannuation 'growth' funds significantly underperform this simple baseline.**

Any superannuation 'growth' fund that does not _at least match_ the S&P 500 returns should be considered a terrible poor performance, and extremely mis-managed.

> If your superannuation fund performance does not _at least match_ 12% you may want to consider a Self Managed Super Fund and simply 'dollar cost average' into an Exchange Traded Fund paired with the S&P 500 baseline.

## Retirement Lifestyles

The ASFA "comfortable" retirement should be used as minimum baseline. Its reasonably "good" but is not luxurious.

The "modest" retirement is a borderline survival level, with basic and limited expenses, cheap old car, and a _"need to keep close watch on utility costs and make sacrifices"_.

I extended the model with additional levels factored at 200%, 300% and 500% of the "modest" lifestyle.

| Couple  | Modest  | Comfortable | Four Star | Luxury   | Opulent  |
|---------|--------:|------------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| Annual  | $50,000 |     $75,000 |  $100,000 | $150,000 | $250,000 |
| Monthly | $4,166  |      $6,250 |    $8,333 |  $12,500 |  $20,833 |
| Diff    | 100%    |        150% |      200% |     300% |     500% |

"Luxury" lifestyle could include for example, economy upgrade to business class, the "opulent" lifestyle is first class.

The models _assume you own your own home_ so take any additional mortgage expenses into account.
