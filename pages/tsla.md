# Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla IPO on the NASDAQ on 29 June 2010. The shares were priced at $17 and opened for trading at $19 finishing the day at $23.89; split adjusted to current (2023) price is $1.59.

The Model S was launched in June 2012 and Tesla had a significant spike in 2013 (up 600% year over year) as the company reported their first ever profitable quarter in 2013.

Subsequent quarters returned to net losses of hundreds of millions of dollars until Tesla demonstrated final mass production of the Model 3 in 2019 and survived the last make-or-break risk of bankruptcy if they failed. The share price spiked in 2019 (up 1000%) helped in part by the macro environment of low interest rates, low inflation and boom in tech stock growth.

The Year over Year annual price change helps visualize potential investment returns, with Tesla reasonably consistent between +10% to +15% YoY between 2017 to 2020. As Tesla delivered on their long term plan of growing vehicle production at a compound annual growth rate of 50%, the share price ramped and stayed over 200% YoY between 2021 to 2023. 

With significant variation, some periods Tesla price "only" increases around 10% YoY and at other times over 200%, the average YoY increase is around 100% - price doubles every year.

> The data suggests reasonable confidence using a baseline stock market performance of 15% to 20% over a multi-decade time horizon, with some uncertainty or risk that stocks can go up or down for short periods of time. Note this does not take inflation into consideration.
