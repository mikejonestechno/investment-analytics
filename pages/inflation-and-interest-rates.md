title: Inflation and Interest Rates
---
The Consumer Price Index that the Reserve Bank of Australia use to index inflation rocketed through the roof in the 1970s peaking at 18% in 1975. 

Since the mid 1990s inflation has been reasonably stable, staying close to the RBA target inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent for over twenty five years.

> The data suggests reasonable confidence using a baseline inflation of 2% to 3% with some uncertainty or risk that inflation could peak higher.
