# Investment Analytics

This project was created to provide some guidelines and forecasts for the following questions:

- How much do I need to retire? 
- How much will inflation or interest rates affect my retirement portfolio, both before and during retirement? 
- How much do I need in my investment portfolio today in order to have acrued enough to retire in the future?
