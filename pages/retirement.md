## How much do I need to retire?

This page plots a retirement fund portfolio for different lifestyle scenarios. 

Annual retirement expenses are based on data from the [Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia](retirement-planning.md). Expenses are plotted for different 'lifestyle' models:


| modest | comfortable | four-star | luxury | opulent |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| $45,000 | $70,000 | $90,000 | $140,000 | $230,000 |




Assume I desire a fund to cover a life expectancy to 100 years.
How much would I need from age 50 to 100?

This model excludes inflation, the true funds required would be much higher.
