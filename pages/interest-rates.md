The Housing Loan Lending Rates are set by the Reserve Bank of Australia and published monthly within five business days after month end.

Australian interest rates ramped up from 6% in 1970 to a peak 17% in 1990 before dropping sharply back down to 10% in 1992.

Interest rates remained reasonably volatile with some sharp spikes and sudden drops, but overall trended down to 5% in 2020, before spiking back over 8% in 2023.
