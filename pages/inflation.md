The Consumer Price Index that the Reserve Bank of Australia use to index inflation is published quarterly, one month after the end of each quarter.

Inflation rocketed through the roof in the 1970s peaking at 18% in 1975. 

Inflation remained highly volatile but eventually stabilized through the 1990s, and was trending slightly down through the 2000s until the spike back up to 8% at the end of 2022.
