The Consumer Price Index that the Reserve Bank of Australia use to index inflation is published quarterly, one month after the end of each quarter.

Inflation rocketed through the roof in the 1970s peaking at 18% in 1975. 

Inflation remained highly volatile but eventually stabilized through the 1990s and has been trending slightly down until the sharp rise in 2021.

Calculating the 25th and 75th percentile over a 10 year time horizon helps visualize the lower and upper long term trends.

Over the last 10 years the median (50th percetile) change is 1.90%.

Over the last 30 years the median (50th percetile) change is 2.40%.

| years |25 | 50 | 75 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 5.85 | 6.50 | 7.20 |
| 10 | 1.50 | 1.90 | 3.00 |
| 30 | 1.70 | 2.40 | 3.12 |




The chart shows inflation stayed close to the RBA target inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent for over twenty five years.
