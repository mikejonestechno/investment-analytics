Calculating the 25th and 75th percentile over multi-year time horizon helps visualize long term trends.



Over the last 10 years the median change is 1.9%:
- 25th percentile YoY change is 1.5%
- 50th percentile YoY change is 1.9%
- 75th percentile YoY change is 3.0%

Over the last 30 years:
- 25th percentile YoY change is 1.7%
- 50th percentile YoY change is 2.4%
- 75th percentile YoY change is 3.12%



The chart shows inflation stayed close to the RBA target inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent for over twenty five years.

> â„¹ The data suggests reasonable confidence using a baseline inflation of 2% to 2.5% with some uncertainty or risk that inflation could peak higher.
