## How much do I need to retire?

There are two primary components:

- How much are my annual expenses?
- How many years of retirement?

This data model is based on annual retirement expense data from the [Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia](retirement-planning.md). Expenses are plotted for different 'lifestyle' scenarios:


| Lifestyle | Modest | Comfortable | Four-star | Luxury | Opulent |
|-----------|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Annual    | $45,000| $70,000| $90,000| $140,000| $230,000 |
| Monthly   | $3,800| $5,800| $7,500| $11,700| $19,200 |




The chart below shows the retirement fund required for up to 51 years of retirement:

This model excludes inflation, the true funds required would be much higher as expenses will increase over time.

This model also assumes a cash fund that excludes interest, yield or appreciation. The funds required would be much less if the fund earnt or accrued value over time.
