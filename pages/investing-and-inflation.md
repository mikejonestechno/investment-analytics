## [Inflation](inflation.html)

The Consumer Price Index that the Reserve Bank of Australia use to index inflation is published quarterly, one month after the end of each quarter.

See [inflation](inflation.html) for inflation charts, trends and analysis.

While inflation may have a direct impact on company profitability and subsequently market prices, there is not a strong correlation between inflation and investment returns.

The S&P 500 Index is reasonably volatility over a multi year time horizon regardless of inflation.
